Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test is used to assess whether a given time series is stationary or non-stationary. It involves defining null and alternate hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis: Time Series is non-stationary, indicating a time-dependent trend.
Alternate Hypothesis: Time Series is stationary, meaning it doesn't depend on time.

The test involves comparing the ADF or t Statistic with critical values:
- ADF or t Statistic < critical values: Reject the null hypothesis, indicating the time series is stationary.
- ADF or t Statistic > critical values: Fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating the time series is non-stationary.

The provided Python code implements the test and displays relevant statistics, including the ADF Statistic, p-value, and Critical Values. The final decision is based on comparing the ADF Statistic with the critical values.
"""


[[code]]
explanation = """
Interpretation of Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test Results
The obtained p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, and the ADF statistic is higher than any of the critical values.

Interpretation:
- p-value > 0.05: Fail to reject the null hypothesis.
- ADF Statistic > Critical Values: Fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Conclusion:
There is no reason to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, the time series is confirmed to be non-stationary.

Converting Data to Stationary - Logarithmic Transformation with Box-Cox

The Box-Cox transform is applied to the 'value' column of the DataFrame using the boxcox function with lambda (lmbda) set to 0.0, which corresponds to a log transformation.

Steps:
1. df_log_scaled = df  # Copy the original DataFrame.
2. df_log_scaled['value'] = boxcox(df_log_scaled['value'], lmbda=0.0)  # Apply Box-Cox log transformation to the 'value' column.

The resulting DataFrame is then visualized to show the effect of the logarithmic transformation on the data.

Note: The Box-Cox transformation helps stabilize the variance and make the time series data more stationary.
