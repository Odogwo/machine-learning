  The observed near-normal distribution (bell-curve) over consumption values in the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)
  plot suggests that the data has a relatively symmetric distribution.

  Additionally, a time series typically comprises three systematic components and one non-systematic component:

  - **Level:** Represents the average value in the series.
  - **Trend:** Signifies the increasing or decreasing pattern in the series.
  - **Seasonality:** Reflects the repeating short-term cycle in the series.
  - **Noise:** Represents the random variation in the series.

  To conduct a comprehensive time series analysis, it is essential to separate seasonality and trend from the series.

  **Non-Systematic Components:**
  - **Seasonality:** Reflects the repeating short-term cycle or pattern in the series. Seasonality typically occurs at regular intervals, such as daily, monthly, or yearly patterns.
  - **Noise:** Represents the random variation or irregularity in the series. It includes unpredictable factors that contribute to short-term fluctuations but do not follow a discernible pattern.

  The user provides an insight into evaluating the effectiveness of the ARIMA 
  model by comparing the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) values. The lower the RSS value, 
  the more effective the model is considered. The user advises trying different combinations of parameters, 
  such as (2,1,0), (3,1,1), etc., and selecting the model with the smallest RSS value for better performance.
